It has been over a month since the initial Swift open source announcement and I still keep discovering new things. I'm still just as excited to watch Swift grow and evolve. Welcome to issue #6 of the weekly brief!

<!--excerpt-->

### Commits and pull requests

[Anton Blanchard](https://github.com/antonblanchard){:target="_blank"} has his [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/979){:target="_blank"} merged which adds PowerPC64le Linux support. [Impressive](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/979#issuecomment-171833623){:target="_blank"} and [very cool](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/979#issuecomment-171876376){:target="_blank"}, indeed. 😎

**@lplarson** submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/997){:target="_blank"} to support code coverage analysis. Glad to see this. It would be great to get automatic reports on pull requests, too.

Chris Lattner continued his [late night hobby](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm/status/674254974629502976){:target="_blank"} &mdash; [fixing](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/20263bf46658dccafced86955fbf33ad72853c6d){:target="_blank"} [more](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/ce94e0af538f9f7e47dc1979e4db60549ffb9010){:target="_blank"} [radars](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/9c9ddf9e6cba3ea199bcfd59e039c404b68bb1ac){:target="_blank"}.

The curious case of the `associatedtype` ([proposal here](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0011-replace-typealias-associated.md){:target="_blank"}): Greg Titus [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/964){:target="_blank"} `associatedtype`. 👏 Then **@eeckstein** [reverted](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/ce7b2bcf094a17fec1a3f3cfa713995f3ced1ef3){:target="_blank"} the change due to failing tests. Doug Gregor then [reverted the revert](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/38c1de69e4b4c27ac1916d1e6fe601beb5d3a5f4){:target="_blank"} with fixed tests. ([Yo dawg, I heard you like reverts](http://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/58010858.jpg){:target="_blank"}) Long story short, `associatedtype` is now implemented for Swift 2.2. 😎

Greg Titus also [updated](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/976){:target="_blank"} the stdlib for `associatedtype`. And [Luke Howard](https://github.com/lhoward){:target="_blank"} merged a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/230){:target="_blank"} to update corelibs-foundation. 🎉

Stephen Celis [cleaned up](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/234){:target="_blank"} `NSDateFormatter`. This is not necessarily a notable change, but what's interesting to me is that `NSDateFormatter` was originally implemented with Objective-C style (now referred to as *"old school"* style) ivars and public getters/setters. This is precisely the kind of boilerplate that Swift aims to reduce. 😂 Another alarming thing is that the non-public properties were marked as `internal` rather than `private`, meaning the entire Foundation module had readwrite access and could bypass the public getters/setters. 🤔 Odd. Here's an example:

{% highlight swift %}
// Before this commit
internal var _dateStyle: NSDateFormatterStyle = .NoStyle
public var dateStyle: NSDateFormatterStyle {
   get {
       return _dateStyle
   }
   set {
       _reset()
       _dateStyle = newValue
   }
}

// After this commit
public var dateStyle: NSDateFormatterStyle = .NoStyle {
    willSet {
        _reset()
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Also remember that Swift's `willSet`/`didSet` property observers were available since 1.0, which makes this even more bizarre. However, it's most likely that this was automatically [generated from an Objective-C interface](https://twitter.com/jckarter/status/689157377149415424){:target="_blank"}. In that case, I'm sure there are plenty of areas that could use improvements. Keep digging!

Ted Kremenek [fixed two regressions](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1007){:target="_blank"} from Swift 2.1 related to parameter parsing.

### Proposals

The main [README on swift-evolution](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution#development-minor-version--swift-22){:target="_blank"} has been updated to track already implemented and accepted proposals for Swift 2.2. This is a great way to see high-level progress at a glance. Of course, I'll keep you up-to-date too. 😉

Jacob Bandes-Storch has prepared [a proposal](https://github.com/jtbandes/swift-evolution/blob/977a9923fd551491623b6bfd398d5859488fe1ae/proposals/0000-derived-collection-of-enum-cases.md){:target="_blank"}, *"Derived Collection of Enum Cases"*. This proposal would provide a much needed reflection API for `enum`. Jacob suggests adding an `Array` property on `enum` types, `.cases`, which returns an array of all cases in the `enum`. Currently, we have to write this manually.

Doug Gregor's [proposal](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0022-objc-selectors.md){:target="_blank"} from last week's issue, *"Referencing the Objective-C selector of a method"*, is [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-January/000020.html){:target="_blank"}.

[Jeff Kelley](https://github.com/SlaunchaMan){:target="_blank"} submitted [a proposal](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/110/files){:target="_blank"}, *"Import Objective-C constants as Swift enums"*. The goal here is to expose groups of Objective-C string constants to Swift as an `enum` instead. This would apply to other types as well, such as groups of integer constants. 👍

Doug Gregor's [proposal](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0021-generalized-naming.md){:target="_blank"}, *"Naming Functions with Argument Labels"*, has been [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-January/000021.html){:target="_blank"} for Swift 2.2 and 3.0.

### Mailing lists

Last week, I missed that John Lin started [working on a Chinese translation](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20160111/000777.html){:target="_blank"} of Swift.org ([here](https://swiftlang.tw){:target="_blank"}). This week, Ted Kremenek [continued the thread](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20160118/000856.html){:target="_blank"} noting that Swift.org is a Jekyll site, currently hosted on GitHub in a private repository, and that team is planning to eventually make it open source! 🎉

Also from last week (😁), Matthew Johnson's *"Flexible Memberwise Initialization"* [proposal](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0018-flexible-memberwise-initialization.md){:target="_blank"} has been "rejected", though it is really more like "deferred until after Swift 3". As Chris Lattner [explains](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160111/006469.html){:target="_blank"}, *"the core team really doesn’t want to discuss this right now, given that this is purely a sugar proposal and we need to stay focused on the primary Swift 3 goals."*

Swift currently has no way to specify if subclasses are required to call `super` for overridden methods. I started a [discussion](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160111/006878.html){:target="_blank"} to present some ideas for a solution to this by extending the use of `required` to class methods other than `init`. (Technically, it began on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jesse_squires/status/686960179435323392){:target="_blank"}, and [Nate Birkholz](https://twitter.com/nbirkholz){:target="_blank"} kindly [started the thread](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160111/006667.html){:target="_blank"} on the mailing list.) Matthew Johnson has since [pointed out](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160118/006912.html){:target="_blank"} additional deficiencies in this area. Of course, you could always make all your methods be initailizers &mdash; [problem solved](https://twitter.com/jckarter/status/686958750335279108){:target="_blank"}. 😂

Davide Italiano [announced](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20160118/000911.html){:target="_blank"} that Swift is now functional on FreeBSD.

The second review of the *"Swift Testing (Package Manager)"* proposal [has begun](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-build-dev/Week-of-Mon-20160111/000243.html){:target="_blank"}! (Revised proposal [here](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0019-package-manager-testing.md){:target="_blank"}). 🎉
