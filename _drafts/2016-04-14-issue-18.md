If you have not [heard it already](https://twitter.com/modocache/status/720139771771805697), the big news this week is that the [port to Android](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1442) pull request from [Brian Gesiak](https://twitter.com/modocache) and [Zhuowei Zhang](https://twitter.com/zhuowei) has finally [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1442#issuecomment-209215000) after a month and a half of review and discussion. 🎉 👏 🙌 No matter what, this was going to be significant addition to Swift. However, as [Dave Verwer noted](https://iosdevweekly.com/issues/245#start) in *iOS Dev Weekly* last week, it seems even more important given the [recent rumors](http://thenextweb.com/dd/2016/04/07/google-facebook-uber-swift/) that Google may be considering Swift for Android.

As mentioned last week, the [Swift 2.2.x milestone](https://github.com/apple/swift/pulls?q=milestone%3A%22Swift+2.2.x%22) is still open and remains unchanged &mdash; all 33 issues closed. The Swift 2.2 [branch](https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/swift-2.2-branch) is currently 363 commits ahead of master, but the most recent activity was 8 days ago. Maybe we'll see an official release soon?

### Starter tasks

- [SR-1187](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1187): [SPM] Add example test to Dealer example
- [SR-1174](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1174): [llbuild] Properly escape verbose command descriptions
- [SR-580](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-580): [Compiler] Warning should be produced for "variable was never mutated"

### Community

In other exciting news, [@NatashaTheRobot](https://twitter.com/NatashaTheRobot/status/720234080860815360) is organizing another *try! Swift* conference. This time it will be in [NYC](http://www.tryswiftnyc.com). The first one was great, so I highly recommend attending if you can. The current list of speakers looks great! 🤓

I just noticed this week that [Nate Cook](https://twitter.com/nnnnnnnn) has updated [swiftdoc.org](http://swiftdoc.org) to include not only the latest Swift 2.2 docs, but multiple [other versions](http://swiftdoc.org/versions/) of the stdlib &mdash; including Swift 3.0 from swift/master and the new index model. This is such a great resource! 🙇 The entire site and other tools are on [GitHub](https://github.com/SwiftDocOrg) if you want to contribute. I also noticed the updated copyright footer on the site, *"All content copyright © 2014–2016 __Apple Inc.__ All rights reserved."* 😧

### Commits and pull requests

Harlan Haskins opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2092) that adds a fixit to hide the first parameter label in functions. This is part of the effort to implement [SE-0046](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0046-first-label.md): *Establish consistent label behavior across all parameters including first labels*.

Daniel Duan [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2087) some changes to clean up SILGen, eliminating SILGen for `var` parameters in functions, which are being removed in Swift 3.

Manav Gabhawala opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2124) that fixes an infinite recursion in the compiler when inheriting from a member of the same type.

Joe Groff [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2086) changes that allow subclasses of specific instantiations of Objective-C generic classes.

Michael Buckley opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2163) that implements his proposal, [SE-0016](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0016-initializers-for-converting-unsafe-pointers-to-ints.md): *Add initializers to `Int` and `UInt` to convert from `UnsafePointer` and `UnsafeMutablePointer`*. ([SR-1115](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1115))

**@goloveychuk** [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/243) changes to swift-package-manager to fix an issue where SPM did not support Xcode project generation for system packages. ([SR-1169](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1169))

Brian Gesiak [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2081) changes that unify the Linux and FreeBSD modulemaps with gyb to reduce code duplication.

Daniel Cohen Gindi opened and later closed a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2125) to allow `Strideable` to have a zero size. *"But moreover, Xcode itself expects it to allow 0 length stride. As Xcode automatically converts old for-loops to strides, it actually breaks code that may in some cases have zero-length strides."* This is definitely something to watch out for if you are migrating to Swift 2.2 with Xcode's migration tool. As [noted](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2125#issuecomment-208191381) on the pull request, this particular patch was not the right one, but it has convinced Dave Abrahams that there needs to be a `stride` function that works for this case.

Michael Ilseman [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2107) a first draft of his proposal, [SE-0044](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0044-import-as-member.md): *Import as member*, for the CoreGraphics APIs.

Trent Nadeau [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2103) changes for part of [SR-1052](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1052), which is tracking the implementation of [SE-0047](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0047-nonvoid-warn.md): *Defaulting non-Void functions so they warn on unused results*. His patch adds the `@discardableResult` attribute to imported C declarations without the Clang `warn_unused_result` attribute.

Manav Gabhawala opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2123) that fixes the `IterativeTypeChecker` and better manages circular protocol inheritance. *"Improves the diagnostics produced for circular protocol inheritance, further it improves the IterativeTypeChecker to use loops instead of recursion to help minimize the stack size and lastly improves the efficiency of detecting circular inheritance by making it a part of the main cycle when checking for inherited protocols."*

And finally &mdash; if you work on the linker, you must be [willing to relocate C++](https://twitter.com/jckarter/status/719684649027391488). 😅
