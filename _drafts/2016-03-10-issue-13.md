Welcome to issue #13 of the weekly brief! This week Apple released beta 6 of iOS 9.3, watchOS 2.2, and OS X 10.11.4, with no new beta for Xcode 7.3 &mdash; the final release should be getting close!

### Commits and pull requests

Anna Zaks [added](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1434) basic address sanitizer (ASan) support. This allows catching and diagnosing memory corruption errors, which are possible
when using unsafe pointers. *"This patch introduces a new driver/frontend option `-sanitize=address` to enable ASan function instrumentation."* 😎 [Live dangerously](https://twitter.com/jckarter/status/704513575801335808). (I missed this from last week!)

Eugene Gubin [submitted a fix](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/276) to correct the wrong behavior of `NSArray.indexOfObject(_: ...)` in corelibs-foundation.

Max Howell opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/174) for Xcode project generation for SPM. This is the start of [the plans](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160215/010679.html) for Xcode integration in SPM. 👏

Dmitri Gribenko [started work](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1545) on the new collection indexing model for Swift 3.

Ankit Agarwal [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/168) changes to SPM that add `-h` and `--help` to `swift test`, and allow passing arguments to `-XCTest` directly. These changes were proposed in [SE-0019](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0019-package-manager-testing.md), *Package Manager Testing*.

Shawn Erickson also [contributed](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1559) to the Swift 3 indexing model work-in-progress, building out the `Collection.next(i: Index) -> Index` APIs. 🙇

Brian Croom [submitted a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/pull/64) to corelibs-xctest that allows selecting a particular test or test case to run from the command line. [Very cool](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/pull/64#issuecomment-192963006). 😎

Greg Titus [started work](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1557) on `typealias` versus `associatedtype` in protocols for Swift 3. These changes remove the Swift 2.2 use of `typealias` and make `associatedtype` required for generic protocols, and allow using `typealias` as an actual type alias.

Brian Gesiak [committed](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/commit/df734dee53bc501da19948cbb8c266a093fa076e) adding the asynchronous testing API (`XCTestCase.waitForExpectationsWithTimeout()`) to corelibs-xctest. This means asynchronous testing is now available on Linux! 👏

Jason Molenda [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1589) changes that allow Swift to be build for iphoneos-armv7s (used in Apple A6 and later 32-bit devices).

Ankit Agarwal opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/183) for a basic implementation of [SE-0038](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0038-swiftpm-c-language-targets.md), allow SPM to be used to create and build C libraries! 🎉 For clients, it looks like all you need to do is include your C sources and a `.modulemap`. 😎

Maxim Moiseev [migrated](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/271) corelibs-foundation to Swift 3, per the Swift 3 API guidelines changes.
