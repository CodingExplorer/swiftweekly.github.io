If I missed anyone, please [submit a pull request]({{ site.links.pull }}) to update the list! üòÑ This week also brought us [Xcode 7.3 beta 5](http://adcdownload.apple.com/Developer_Tools/Xcode_7.3_beta_5/Xcode_7.3_beta_5_Release_Notes.pdf). Hopefully we are getting close to the final release.

### Commits and pull requests

The other big news from the past week was Brian Gesiak's [port to Android](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1442) pull request. [This is really awesome to see.](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1442#issuecomment-188997429) üôá üëè

Harlan Haskins has [opened a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1417) that adds a code coverage comparison visualization tool. ü§ì

C.W. Betts submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/251) to implement `NSUserDefaults` in corelibs-foundation.

Patrick Pijnappel [rewrote](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1477) `UTF8._isValidUTF8()` to improve performance and reduce code size. Depending on the sequence, there's a 15-45% speed-up. [This is brilliant](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1477#issuecomment-189788033)! üòé

Nadav Rotem [disabled the in-lining](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/493f4e3747ce2f7faf238b809a17018593dc1bb9) of `measureExtendedGraphemeCluster`. *"This change reduced the size of the Swift standard library by about 45k (2% of the .text size)."*

Guillaume Lessard submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1454) to fix [SR-192](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-192), *"Weak properties are not thread safe when reading"*, reported by [Mike Ash](https://twitter.com/mikeash).

Honza Dvorsky opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/159) (previous discussion [here](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/156)) to generate `XCTestCaseProvider` entries on Linux ([SR-710](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-710)).

Ankit Agarwal submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/149) to add support for empty source packages ([SR-793](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-793)).

Daniel Duan opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1501) to implement proposal [SE-0034](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0034-disambiguating-line.md), which replaces the line directive `#line` with `#setline`.

### Proposals

Erica Sadun's proposal, [SE-0034](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0034-disambiguating-line.md): *Disambiguating Line Control Statements from Debugging Identifiers*, has been [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-February/000050.html). *"The community and core team both widely agree that this is a straight-forward fix to an uncommonly used feature."*

Daniel Dunbar's proposal, [SE-0038](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0038-swiftpm-c-language-targets.md): *Package Manager C Language Target Support*, has been [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-build-dev/Week-of-Mon-20160222/000288.html). *"We didn't get a lot of commentary on this proposal, but there appears to be general support for this proposal. [...] While we now have a specification for how this feature should work, we do not yet have a schedule for when we will be able to implement it. If you are interested in contributing an implementation for this proposal, please coordinate with us on the swift-build-dev mailing list."*

David Scr√®ve's proposal, [SE-0026](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0026-abstract-classes-and-methods.md): *Abstract classes and methods*, is now [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-February/000048.html). I'm personally not a fan of this idea. I think that the problems that abstract classes and methods attempt to solve can be better solved with protocols, and design patterns that avoid the need for inheritance in the first place. [David Owens II](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160222/011163.html) and [Austin Zheng](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160222/011168.html) offer their views against and in favor, respectively. Overall feedback on the mailing lists is mixed.

Ilya Belenkiy's proposal, [SE-0025](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0025-scoped-access-level.md): *Scoped Access Level*, is now [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-February/000049.html). It aims to introduce a new access level modifier, `local`, which would make the specified members private to their class/struct. Support for this is mixed and I can understand both sides. [Stephen Celis](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160222/011201.html) and [Brent Royal-Gordon](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160229/011405.html) have written great responses against this. [Nate Cook](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160222/011210.html) provided his thoughts on why he thinks this is a good change. And [Joe Groff](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160222/011314.html) suggested that this might be solvable with stored properties in extensions instead.

Erica Sadun drafted two proposals for refinements to Strides. So far there is mixed, but most positive support for each of these.

- Conventionalizing `stride` semantics ([here](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/184)). *"Swift offers two stride functions, `stride(to:, by:)` and `stride(through:, by:)`. This proposal introduces a third style and renames the existing to and through styles."*
- Decoupling Floating Point Strides from Generic Implementations ([here](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/185)). *"`Strideable` is genericized across both integer and floating point types. A single implementation causes floating point strides to accumulate errors through repeatedly adding `by` intervals. Floating point types deserve their own floating point-aware implementation that minimizes errors."*

### Mailing lists

Erica Sadun has [started a discussion](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-build-dev/Week-of-Mon-20160222/000289.html) on disambiguating Swift Package Manager naming conflicts (draft proposal [here](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/182/)).
