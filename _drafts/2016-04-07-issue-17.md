Welcome to issue #17! After all this time, the core team is still [just as encouraging](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2001#issuecomment-204765081) to contributors as it was on day one. It's really cool to see this. 😎

### Starter tasks

Suggestions from [Brian Gesiak](https://github.com/SwiftWeekly/swiftweekly.github.io/issues/30):

- [SR-1124](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1124): Migrate legacy Swift stdlib tests to the StdlibUnittest framework. This would make those tests easier to read and maintain. Over the course of completing this task, newcomers to Swift development would become familiar with several tools used to test the compiler. There are 35 tests in total--feel free to claim individual tests by commenting on the task.

### Finally

And finally &mdash; last Friday [Brian Gesiak](https://twitter.com/modocache/status/715703413112176640) made Swift 9,000 times safer with one small [commit](https://github.com/modocache/swift/commit/e5ebd2e9d98eadb7bbddfcdbbf1a1064eb07a9f1). *"Force unwrapping is like totally unsafe."* 😂
