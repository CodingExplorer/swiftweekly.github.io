### Commits and pull requests

Joe Groff [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1297) his property behaviors prototype into `master`. (Note that the pull request was closed.) It is currently hidden behind a frontend flag, `-enable-experimental-property-behaviors`. Joe also [worked on](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1385) handling initial value requirements in property behaviors. *"This lets us implement `lazy` as a property behavior."* 🎉

Joshua Garnham [fixed a bug](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1197) in the parser where a fix-it would suggest moving an `@noescape` attribute declaration to the function attribute position, rather than the parameter. ([SR-215](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-215))

Greg Titus opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1383) to support multiple patterns in `switch` cases that contain variables. *"There was a thread on swift-evolution back on Jan 23rd about adding this, and the response from the team was that it was something desirable but that you just hadn’t had time to do it so far."* 😎 This change will enable things like this:

{% highlight swift %}

enum Foo {
  case A(String, Int)
  case B(Int, String, String)
  case C(Int)
}

func thingy(arg: Foo) -> String {
  var r: String
  switch(arg) {
  case .A(let s, let i), .B(let i, _, let s):
    r = "\(s)\(i)"
  case .C:
    r = "c"
  }
  return r
}

{% endhighlight %}

Brian Gesiak [documented](https://github.com/apple/swift-llbuild/pull/8) the `swift-compiler` tool in swift-llbuid. 🙇

Mishal Shah [added](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1360) a pull request template to support GitHub's [new feature](https://github.com/blog/2111-issue-and-pull-request-templates).

Eric Holscher setup [Swift 2.2 documentation](http://apple-swift.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) on [ReadTheDocs.org](https://readthedocs.org), and [added a link](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/44/files) in the `README`. Now you don't have to build it yourself. 👏 I feel like this was the purpose of the [Swift Internals](http://apple.github.io/swift-internals/) site, yet it still has not been updated to include these. 🤔
