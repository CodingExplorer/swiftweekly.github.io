This week brought us [Xcode 7.3 beta2](https://twitter.com/SwiftLang/status/691805674079195136) &mdash; the first official Xcode release that bundles Swift 2.2 *and* includes contributions from the Swift.org open source community! I never thought I would see [release notes](http://adcdownload.apple.com/Developer_Tools/Xcode_7.3_beta_2/Xcode_7.3_beta_2_Reease_Notes.pdf) like this.  It really is incredible to see community-driven changes in the *What's New* sections with links to GitHub. Clearly, the next big step for Apple should be open sourcing Xcode itself. (Well, we can dream, right?)
