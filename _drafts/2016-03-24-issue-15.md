Swift 2.2 has been [released](https://swift.org/blog/swift-2-2-released/)! It includes contributions from 212 non-Apple contributors and 7 Swift evolution proposals. I agree with [Ayaka](https://twitter.com/ayanonagon/status/712076521368739840), non-stringly-typed Objective-C selectors are so great. The final version of [Xcode 7.3](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/releasenotes/DeveloperTools/RN-Xcode/Chapters/xc7_release_notes.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001051-CH5-DontLinkElementID_29) was also released, which includes Swift 2.2 and other improvements. And of course, there were a number of interesting announcements at Apple's [special event](http://www.apple.com/apple-events/march-2016/) on Monday. [This](https://twitter.com/stringcode/status/711963672243994625) was my favorite new product. ðŸ˜„
