Swift 2.2 has been [released](https://swift.org/blog/swift-2-2-released/)! It includes contributions from 212 non-Apple contributors and 7 Swift evolution proposals. Be sure to read Ted Kremenek's [announcement](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-March/000071.html) on the mailing list for more details. The final version of [Xcode 7.3](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/releasenotes/DeveloperTools/RN-Xcode/Chapters/xc7_release_notes.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001051-CH5-DontLinkElementID_29) was also released, which includes Swift 2.2 and other [improvements](https://twitter.com/Catfish_Man/status/711972673367052288). Hopefully you were able to upgrade [successfully](https://twitter.com/ericasadun/status/712036220818350081). 😅

Regarding new features, I agree with [Ayaka](https://twitter.com/ayanonagon/status/712076521368739840) that having non-stringly-typed Objective-C selectors is so great. And of course, there were a number of interesting announcements at Apple's [special event](http://www.apple.com/apple-events/march-2016/) on Monday. [This](https://twitter.com/stringcode/status/711963672243994625) was my favorite new product. 😄

- [SR-873](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-873): Python Benchmark Driver needs unit tests

### Commits and pull requests

I noticed that [**@swift-ci**](https://github.com/swift-ci) expanded its repertoire recently. When [first announced](https://swift.org/blog/swift-ci/), the core team could trigger running the full test suite by commenting "__@swift-ci__ Please test" on pull requests. Now, commenting "__@swift-ci__ Please [smoke test](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1750#issuecomment-199074599)" will only build the target projects to make sure they build successfully. Even more, there's "__@swift-ci__ Please [perf test](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1682#issuecomment-199569395)" which will run performance tests and then [leave a comment](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1682#issuecomment-199628576) noting any regressions, improvements, and unchanged results for both `-O` and `-Onone` optimization levels. 😎 If only we could say, [please fix](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1740#issuecomment-198777108)... 😂

Shawn Erickson submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1731) to unify mutexes in the Swift runtime, resolving [SR-946](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-946).

Jesse Rusak opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1732) that implements proposal [SE-0037](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0037-clarify-comments-and-operators.md): *Clarify interaction between comments & operators*. This proposal was accepted as a bug, and resolves [SR-186](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-186) and [SR-960](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-960).

Taylor Franklin [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/288) the remaining `NSDateFormatter` attributes and added more tests, resolving [SR-208](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-208).

Ian Partridge submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/291) that implements `NSJSONSerialization.dataWithJSONObject(_:options:)`.

Slava Pestov [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/ebb8d7392c8f3da07bb299ed0d6a240c0eb07a49) leaking the error value when using `try?`, resolving [SR-972](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-972).

David Grove of IBM opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-libdispatch/pull/61) to rework the corelibs-libdispatch overlay for Linux. It resolves [SR-739](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-739), [SR-740](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-740), [SR-737](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-737). *"This commit fixes all of these issues by injecting a complete Swift overlay layer that wraps the native libdispatch objects and native APIs."*

Arnold Schwaighofer opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1797) to make `String`'s comparison and hash function faster on platforms that use Objective-C inter-op by using a stack allocated `_NSContiguousString`. The change provides a 1.2x to 2.2x speedup. 😎

Arsen Gasparyan [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1761) a patch that replaced `if true { }` with `do { }` in some test files. Odd. 🤔 My guess is that these tests predated the introduction of `do { }`? In any case, consider this your occasional reminder that there are always opportunities for small, easy wins like code cleanup. Get involved!

Another interesting thing I noticed was in Neil Kimmett's [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1323) to add `.zero` convenience static vars for `UIEdgeInsets` and `UIOffset`. This required internal discussion with the UIKit team to [get approval](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1323#issuecomment-199417826) for the change. 😳

### Proposals

Michael Buckley's proposal, [SE-0016](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0016-initializers-for-converting-unsafe-pointers-to-ints.md): *Add initializers to `Int` and `UInt` to convert from `UnsafePointer` and `UnsafeMutablePointer`*, is now [under review](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-March/000072.html). From the introduction: *"Just as users can create `Unsafe[Mutable]Pointers` from `Int`s and `UInt`s, they should be able to create `Int`s and `UInt`s from `Unsafe[Mutable]Pointers`. This will allow users to call C functions with `intptr_t` and `uintptr_t` parameters, and will allow users to perform more advanced pointer arithmetic than is allowed by UnsafePointers."* It seems like a rather straightforward API change that will improve inter-op with C. There isn't much feedback on the mailing lists, but so far it's positive.

### Mailing lists

Chris Lattner [started a thread](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160314/012604.html) to revive discussions on proposal [SE-0025](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0025-scoped-access-level.md): *Scoped Access Level*.

>To summarize the place we’d like to end up:
>
>- “public” -> symbol visible outside the current module.
>- “internal” -> symbol visible within the current module.
>- unknown -> symbol visible within the current file.
>- “private” -> symbol visible within the current declaration (class, extension, etc).
>
>The rationale here is that this aligns Swift with common art seen in other languages, and that many people using private today don’t *want* visibility out of their current declaration.  It also encourages “extension oriented programming”, at least it will when some of the other restrictions on extensions are lifted.  We discussed dropping the third one entirely, but think it *is* a useful and important level of access control, and when/if we ever get the ability to write unit tests inside of the file that defines the functionality, they will be a nicer solution to `@testable`.
>
> The thing we need to know is what the spelling should be for the third one...

As you can imagine, an explicit request for bikeshedding has resulted in a tremendous thread. It looks like the consensus so far is for `private`, `private(module)`, `private(file)` &mdash; which [James Berry](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160314/012609.html) suggested. I think this is great. 👍 Shawn Erickson [pointed out](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160314/012635.html) that this puts the current `private(set)` in an awkward position, but it's [always been weird](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160314/012639.html) anyway.

### Finally

And finally &mdash; from now on, we shall refer to "compiler bugs" as [not-yet-implemented features](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160321/013095.html). 😄 Feel free to assign any tasks to Dave Abrahams. 😉
