Swift 2.2 has been [released](https://swift.org/blog/swift-2-2-released/)! It includes contributions from 212 non-Apple contributors and 7 Swift evolution proposals. I agree with [Ayaka](https://twitter.com/ayanonagon/status/712076521368739840), non-stringly-typed Objective-C selectors are so great. The final version of [Xcode 7.3](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/releasenotes/DeveloperTools/RN-Xcode/Chapters/xc7_release_notes.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001051-CH5-DontLinkElementID_29) was also released, which includes Swift 2.2 and other [improvements](https://twitter.com/Catfish_Man/status/711972673367052288). And of course, there were a number of interesting announcements at Apple's [special event](http://www.apple.com/apple-events/march-2016/) on Monday. [This](https://twitter.com/stringcode/status/711963672243994625) was my favorite new product. 😄

### Commits and pull requests

I noticed that [**@swift-ci**](https://github.com/swift-ci) expanded its repertoire recently. When [first announced](https://swift.org/blog/swift-ci/), the core team could trigger running the full test suite by commenting *"__@swift-ci__ Please test"* on pull requests. Now, commenting *"__@swift-ci__ Please [smoke test](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1750#issuecomment-199074599)"* will only build the target projects to make sure they build successfully. Even more, there's *"__@swift-ci__ Please [perf test](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1682#issuecomment-199569395)"* which will run performance tests and then [leave a comment](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1682#issuecomment-199628576) noting any regressions, improvements, and unchanged results for both `-O` and `-Onone` optimization levels. 😎 If only we could say, [please fix](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1740#issuecomment-198777108)... 😂

Shawn Erickson submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1731) to unify mutexes in the Swift runtime, resolving [SR-946](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-946).

Jesse Rusak opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1732) that implements proposal [SE-0037](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0037-clarify-comments-and-operators.md): *Clarify interaction between comments & operators*. This proposal was accepted as a bug, and resolves [SR-186](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-186) and [SR-960](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-960).

Taylor Franklin [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/288) the remaining `NSDateFormatter` attributes and added more tests, resolving [SR-208](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-208).

Ian Partridge submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/291) that implements `NSJSONSerialization.dataWithJSONObject(_:options:)`.

Slava Pestov [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/ebb8d7392c8f3da07bb299ed0d6a240c0eb07a49) leaking the error value when using `try?`, resolving [SR-972](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-972).

David Grove of IBM a opened [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-libdispatch/pull/61) to rework the corelibs-libdispatch overlay for Linux. It resolves [SR-739](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-739), [SR-740](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-740), [SR-737](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-737). *"This commit fixes all of these issues by injecting a complete Swift overlay layer that wraps the native libdispatch objects and native APIs."*

Arsen Gasparyan [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1761) a patch that replaced `if true { }` with `do { }` is some test files. Odd. 🤔 My guess is that these test predated the introduction of `do { }`? In any case, consider this your occasional reminder that there are always opportunities for small, easy wins like code cleanup. Get involved!

Another interesting thing I noticed was in Neil Kimmett's [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1323) to add `.zero` convenience static vars for `UIEdgeInsets` and `UIOffset`. This required internal discussion with the UIKit team to [get approval](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1323#issuecomment-199417826) for the change. 😳
