Welcome to issue #16! Last week's exciting news on the release of Swift 2.2 has been followed up by an [official blog post](https://swift.org/blog/swift-2-2-new-features/) detailing the new features. Check it out if you haven't already.

Also of interest is that Apple started a new beta program for Safari, [Safari Technology Preview](https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/). This doesn't have much to do with Swift, but to me it seems like perhaps Swift's openness is starting to influence more teams within Apple. Maybe? The recent [CareKit](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2016/03/21Apple-Advances-Health-Apps-with-CareKit.html) announcement also supports this theory. Anyway, I'm still hoping for an open source Xcode. üòÅ

### Commits and pull requests

[Kyle Yoon](https://github.com/yoonapps) completed a swift-corelibs-xctest starter task that [added](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/pull/85) `XCTestCase.expectationForNotification()`. This adds a convenient way to setup asynchronous tests for `NSNotification` on Linux.
