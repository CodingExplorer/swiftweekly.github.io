Welcome to issue #16! Last week's exciting news on the release of Swift 2.2 has been followed up by an [official blog post](https://swift.org/blog/swift-2-2-new-features/) detailing the new features. Check it out if you haven't already.

Also of interest is that Apple started a new beta program for Safari, [Safari Technology Preview](https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/). This doesn't have much to do with Swift, but to me it seems like perhaps Swift's openness is starting to influence more teams within Apple. Maybe? The recent [CareKit](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2016/03/21Apple-Advances-Health-Apps-with-CareKit.html) announcement also supports this theory. Anyway, I'm still hoping for an open source Xcode. üòÅ

### Starter tasks

- [SR-1112](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1112): Wrong suggestion by Fix-it for `if let` unused vars
- [SR-1022](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1022): Missing "unused result" warning for `#selector`
- [SR-1005](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1005): SwiftPM port to Foundation
- [SR-1111](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1111): Non-optimized builds should avoid redundant `thick_to_objc_metatype` conversions

### Commits and pull requests

There's a new [Swift 2.2.x milestone](https://github.com/apple/swift/pulls?utf8=‚úì&q=milestone%3A%22Swift+2.2.x%22+) on GitHub with 16 issues closed and 4 issues open (as of this writing). I haven't seen official announcements about a Swift 2.2.1 (or 2.2.x) release, but it looks like this patch release will be coming soon.

[Kyle Yoon](https://github.com/yoonapps) completed a corelibs-xctest starter task that [added](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/pull/85) `XCTestCase.expectationForNotification()`. This adds a convenient way to setup asynchronous tests for `NSNotification` on Linux. üëè

Mike Griepentrog opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/302) for an initial implementation of `NSURLCredential`.

Jordan Rose opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1878) for a work-in-progress for [SE-0055](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0055-optional-unsafe-pointers.md): *Make unsafe pointer nullability explicit using Optional*.

Manav Gabhawala merged a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1812) to clean up parsing of function parameter attributes, among other things. *"This pull request cleans up parsing of parameter attributes by parsing the `inout`, `let` and `var` tokens better. It cleans up the implementation to work better with [SE-0003](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0003-remove-var-parameters.md) by giving better fix-its and diagnostics for `var` as parameter attributes. It implements [SE-0053](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0053-remove-let-from-function-parameters.md) to disallow `let` as an attribute. It provides better fix-its for `inout` that are either duplicated or misplaced to better implement [SE-0031](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0031-adjusting-inout-declarations.md)."* üòé

Joe Groff opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1938) to fix crashes when calling C functions imported as protocol extension methods.

Pushkar Kulkarni [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/301) a stack corruption issue in `CFRegularExpression`. ü§ì

Nate Cook merged a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1924) that makes `Array`'s conformance to `RangeReplaceableCollection` visible.

Joe Groff [added support](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1816) for importing Objective-C generics as generic classes in Swift.

Brian Gesiak opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/pull/84) that adds `XCTestSuite` announcements to corelibs-xctest. *"This makes the swift-corelibs-xctest and Apple XCTest versions of `XCTestObservation` identical, bringing us closer to our Swift 3 goal of API parity."* üôå

**@tinysun212** [made the stdlib random functions portable](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1939) by removing `arc4random` and using C++ `<random>` instead. This allowed Dmitri Gribenko to [drop the dependency](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1965) on libbsd.

Chris Bailey [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/286) a missing `NSString` initializer in corelibs-foundation:

{% highlight swift %}
public convenience init(format: String, locale: AnyObject?, arguments argList: CVaListPointer)
{% endhighlight %}

Jordan Rose [fixed rdar://24547884](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1820), addressing an issue in the ClangImporter where inherited protocol conformances were not set up correctly. *"This is rdar://problem/24547884, which includes a reference to [facebook/AsyncDisplayKit#1109](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/issues/1109). (As in, this should fix that issue as well. The test case in the Radar included a stripped-down client but the full AsyncDisplayKit.)"*

Brian Gesiak opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1908) that refactors the Cygwin toolchain to address "a great deal of duplication" across the various toolchains.
