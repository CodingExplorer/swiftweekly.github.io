Welcome to issue #16! Last week's exciting news on the release of Swift 2.2 has been followed up by an [official blog post](https://swift.org/blog/swift-2-2-new-features/) detailing the new features. Check it out if you haven't already.

Also of interest is that Apple started a new beta program for Safari, [Safari Technology Preview](https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/). This doesn't have much to do with Swift, but to me it seems like perhaps Swift's openness is starting to influence more teams within Apple. Maybe? The recent [CareKit](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2016/03/21Apple-Advances-Health-Apps-with-CareKit.html) announcement also supports this theory. Anyway, I'm still hoping for an open source Xcode. üòÅ

### Starter tasks

- [SR-1112](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1112): Wrong suggestion by Fix-it for `if let` unused vars
- [SR-1022](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1022): Missing "unused result" warning for `#selector`
- [SR-1005](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1005): SwiftPM port to Foundation
- [SR-1111](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1111): Non-optimized builds should avoid redundant `thick_to_objc_metatype` conversions

### Commits and pull requests

There's a new [Swift 2.2.x milestone](https://github.com/apple/swift/pulls?utf8=‚úì&q=milestone%3A%22Swift+2.2.x%22+) on GitHub with 16 issues closed and 4 issues open (as of this writing). I haven't seen official announcements about a Swift 2.2.1 (or 2.2.x) release, but it looks like this patch release will be coming soon.

[Kyle Yoon](https://github.com/yoonapps) completed a corelibs-xctest starter task that [added](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/pull/85) `XCTestCase.expectationForNotification()`. This adds a convenient way to setup asynchronous tests for `NSNotification` on Linux.

Jordan Rose opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1878) for a work-in-progress for [SE-0055](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0055-optional-unsafe-pointers.md): *Make unsafe pointer nullability explicit using Optional*.

Joe Groff opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1938) to fix crashes when calling C functions imported as protocol extension methods.

Pushkar Kulkarni [fixed](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/301) a stack corruption issue in `CFRegularExpression`.

Joe Groff [added support](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1816) for importing Objective-C generics as generic classes in Swift.

Brian Gesiak opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/pull/84) that adds `XCTestSuite` announcements to corelibs-xctest. *"This makes the swift-corelibs-xctest and Apple XCTest versions of `XCTestObservation` identical, bringing us closer to our Swift 3 goal of API parity."*

Jordan Rose [fixed rdar://24547884](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1820), addressing an issue in the ClangImporter where inherited protocol conformances were not set up correctly. *"This is rdar://problem/24547884, which includes a reference to [facebook/AsyncDisplayKit#1109](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/issues/1109). (As in, this should fix that issue as well. The test case in the Radar included a stripped-down client but the full AsyncDisplayKit.)"*

### Finally

And finally &mdash; I guess we know [Kanye‚Äôs take](https://twitter.com/NeoNacho/status/713184917899714561) on implicitly unwrapped optional now. üòÇ
