This week an [official blog post](https://swift.org/blog/swift-ci/) on Swift.org announced the new continuous integration setup that I mentioned last week. There is now a [dedicated page](https://swift.org/continuous-integration/) on the main site and you can check the status [here](https://ci.swift.org). It seems to be nicely [integrated](https://twitter.com/modocache/status/693069527807041536) with GitHub, and [mostly works](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1151#issuecomment-178211302). 😄

### Commits and pull requests

Erik Eckstein [committed](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/aaaf36e83521f153ba4b0720795efe4980d9b124) some [impressive](https://twitter.com/jckarter/status/693190676666675200) whole module optimization performance improvements. 😎

David Farler [added support](https://github.com/apple/swift/commit/e87be804c9d8111012555263aa86021ab1735ccf) for writing code block comments in any language.

William Dillon followed up on some [previous Linux/ARMv7](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/608) work, this time [submitting a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1157) that adds support for gold linker.

Harlan Haskins [merged a pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1122) that adds backtrace reporting on `fatalError`. 👏

C.W. Betts [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/251) `NSUserDefaults` in corelibs-foundation.

Slava Pestov [started](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1182) on adding support for resiliently adding protocol requirements with default implementations.

Doug Gregor [implemented](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1185) code completion improvements for `#selector`.

### Proposals

Joe Groff and Erica Sadun [submitted a proposal](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/128/files), *"Adjusting `inout` Declarations for Type Decoration"*. They suggest moving the `inout` keyword from the label side to the type side in a function declaration to clarify that this decorates types and avoid confusion with similarly named argument labels.

Nate Cook [has proposed](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/pull/125) to *"Add sequence-based initializers and merge methods to Dictionary"*.

>The `Dictionary` type should allow initialization from a sequence of `(Key, Value)` tuples and offer methods that merge a sequence of `(Key, Value)` tuples with an existing dictionary.

### Mailing lists

> TODO:

And finally &mdash; has Bjarne ever [made the mistake](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1183#commitcomment-15864521) of forgetting the `~` for C++ destructors? Jacob Bandes-Storch [saved the day](https://twitter.com/dgregor79/status/694988732718448642) with this massive [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1183/files). 😂
