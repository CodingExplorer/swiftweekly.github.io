As you must know by now, [WWDC 2016](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/) has been announced! What's most surprising and exciting to me is the emphasis on Swift &mdash; it's all over the WWDC pages on Apple's site. Of course, it's no surprise that Swift 3.0 is coming so it makes me wonder, *what else* is planned for Swift that we don't know about?

In other news, the [Xcode 7.3.1 GM seed](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm/status/722501792450228225) was released. It includes a bunch of bug fixes and [Swift 2.2.1](https://github.com/apple/swift/releases/tag/swift-2.2.1-RELEASE). However, the release notes didn't specify the Swift version and the version number [**did not** get bumped](https://twitter.com/UINT_MIN/status/722821043979595777) in Xcode. But don't worry, the fixes are in there. 😄

### Starter tasks

- [SR-1266](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1266): Remove duplication between `swift/test` and `swift/validation-test` configuration files. This is a good introduction to the Swift build system, its test suite, and CMake.

### Commits and pull requests

Anna Zaks [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2169) some fixes and improvements to the `swift_demangle` API. 🤓

Alex Hoppen submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2224) that implements [SE-0036](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0036-enum-dot.md): *Requiring Leading Dot Prefixes for `enum` Instance Member Implementations*. ([SR-1236](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1236)). 👍

Brian Gesiak opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1714) to begin adding testing support for Android.

Max Howell [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/254) changes that add a flag to make the build output location of SwiftPM configurable.

Daniel Eggert's implementation of `NSHTTPURLResponse` has [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/287). 🎉

Brian Gesiak opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/pull/96) to expand the Linux/FreeBSD check to include Android. It's so weird to see `#if os(Android)`. 😄

Joe Groff [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2210) changes that allow Objective-C generic extensions to perform `@objc` operations involving generics. *"This should allow an extension to use the generic class's own API to some degree, as it would if defined on the non-generic form."*

John Holdsworth submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2197) with an implementation of a swift-format tool to indent swift source code from the command line using the new libIDE API ([SR-146](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-146)). 👏 Unfortunately, it looks like it was closed due to some [git rebasing](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2197#issuecomment-212106820) problems. 😅 It looks like John will open a fresh pull request soon.

Ted Kremenek opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2215) that implements [SE-0039](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0039-playgroundliterals.md): *Modernizing Playground Literals*. 😎

Mauricio Meirelles submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/320) that begins implementing `NSMassFormatter`.

There were a ton of changes merged to corelibs-foundation to update the APIs for the [*Great API Transformation*](https://swift.org/blog/swift-api-transformation/). [It's happening](https://media.giphy.com/media/cD8fdv2wxuy9G/giphy.gif).

* Robert F. Dickerson [updated](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/325) `NSDate`, `NSTimeZone`, and `NSDateFormatter`.
* Pushkar N Kulkarni [updated](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/322) `NSCache` and [updated](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/324) `NSHTTPCookie`.
* **@saiHemak** [updated](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/336) `NSCalendar`.
* Bhaktavatsal Reddy [updated](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/323) `NSData`.

### Accepted proposals

It was a big week for proposals! 🎉

Doug Gregor's proposal, [SE-0057](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0057-importing-objc-generics.md): *Importing Objective-C Lightweight Generics*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-April/000097.html) **for Swift 3**.

> This proposal only received light commentary from the community, but that feedback was universally positive.  The core team agrees that this is will greatly improve the expressivity of imported Objective-C APIs into Swift.  The implementation work is quite far along, and while there are still a couple engineering-level questions left, the design is solid, so we are comfortable accepting it at this point.

Chris Lattner's proposal, [SE-0048](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0048-generic-typealias.md): *Generic Type Aliases*, was [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-April/000098.html) **for Swift 3**. *"The proposal received overwhelmingly positive feedback and has now been implemented for Swift 3."* 😧

Chris Lattner's proposal, [SE-0049](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0049-noescape-autoclosure-type-attrs.md): *Move `@noescape` and `@autoclosure` to be type attributes*, has been [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-April/000099.html) **for Swift 3**. *"Feedback on the proposal was light but positive."* The work for this was tracked at [SR-1235](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1235) and it looks like Chris has finished most of the work. 👏

Erica Sadun's and Chris Lattner's proposal, [SE-0036](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0036-enum-dot.md): *Requiring Leading Dot Prefixes for `enum` Instance Member Implementations*, has been [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-April/000100.html) **for Swift 3**. *"We welcome an implementation of this proposal."* As mentioned above, Alex Hoppen already submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2224) for this. 🎉

David Hart's proposal, [SE-0062](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0062-objc-keypaths.md): *Referencing Objective-C key-paths*, has been [accepted](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution-announce/2016-April/000101.html) **for Swift 3**. This work is being tracked at [SR-1237](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1237).

> The proposal is accepted, with one adjustment to the handling of collections: rather than support any SequenceType as a collection, the core team wants a narrower rule for only the primary Cocoa collection types (`NSArray`, `NSDictionary`, `NSSet`) and their Swift-bridged equivalents (`Array`, `Dictionary`, `Set`), due to implementation concerns. Feedback on this proposal was generally positive, and the proposal fits well with `#selector` ([SE-0022](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0022-objc-selectors.md)).
