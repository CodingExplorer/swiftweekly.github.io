As you must know by now, [WWDC 2016](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/) has been announced! What's most surprising and exciting to me is the emphasis on Swift &mdash; it's all over the WWDC pages on Apple's site. Of course, it's no surprise that Swift 3.0 is coming so it makes me wonder, *what else* is planned for Swift that we don't know about?

In other news, the [Xcode 7.3.1 GM seed](https://twitter.com/clattner_llvm/status/722501792450228225) was released. It includes a bunch of bug fixes and presumably Swift 2.2.1, though the release notes don't specify.

<!--excerpt-->

### Starter tasks

- [SR-1266](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1266): Remove duplication between `swift/test` and `swift/validation-test` configuration files. This is a good introduction to the Swift build system, its test suite, and CMake.

### Commits and pull requests

Anna Zaks [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2169) some fixes and improvements to the `swift_demangle` API. 🤓

Alex Hoppen submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2224) that implements [SE-0036](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0036-enum-dot.md): *Requiring Leading Dot Prefixes for `enum` Instance Member Implementations*. ([SR-1236](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1236)). 👍

Brian Gesiak opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/1714) to begin adding testing support for Android.

Max Howell [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/254) changes that add a flag to make the build output location of SwiftPM configurable.

Daniel Eggert's implementation of `NSHTTPURLResponse` has [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/287). 🎉

Brian Gesiak opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-xctest/pull/96) to expand the Linux/FreeBSD check to include Android. It's so weird to see `#if os(Android)`. 😄

Joe Groff [merged](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2210) changes that allow Objective-C generic extensions to perform `@objc` operations involving generics. *"This should allow an extension to use the generic class's own API to some degree, as it would if defined on the non-generic form."*

John Holdsworth submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2197) with an implementation of a swift-format tool to indent swift source code from the command line using the new libIDE API ([SR-146](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-146)). 👏 Unfortunately, it looks like it was closed due to some [git rebasing](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2197#issuecomment-212106820) problems. 😅 It looks like John will open a fresh pull request soon.

Ted Kremenek opened a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2215) that implements [SE-0039](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0039-playgroundliterals.md): *Modernizing Playground Literals*. 😎

Mauricio Meirelles submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/320) that begins implementing `NSMassFormatter`.

There were a ton of changes merged to corelibs-foundation to update the APIs for the [*Great API Transformation*](https://swift.org/blog/swift-api-transformation/). [It's happening](https://media.giphy.com/media/cD8fdv2wxuy9G/giphy.gif).

* Robert F. Dickerson [updated](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/325) `NSDate`, `NSTimeZone`, and `NSDateFormatter`.
* Pushkar N Kulkarni [updated](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/322) `NSCache` and [updated](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/324) `NSHTTPCookie`.
* **@saiHemak** [updated](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/336) `NSCalendar`.
* Bhaktavatsal Reddy [updated](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/323) `NSData`.
