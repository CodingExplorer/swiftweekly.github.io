Welcome to issue #14 of the weekly brief! Just like [Dave Verwer](https://iosdevweekly.com/issues/241#start), I've been anticipating the final release of Xcode 7.3 &mdash; as well as iOS 9.3, OS X 10.11.4, and watchOS 2.2. Xcode 7.3 will include the final version of Swift 2.2. Perhaps the core team will "[loop us in](http://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/10/apple-invites-march-21-event/)" next Monday. ðŸ˜‰

<!--excerpt-->

### Starter tasks
1. [SR-306](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-306): Add stable sort algorithm
2. [SR-587](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-587): Move Array(count:repeatedValue:) to RangeReplaceableCollection

<!---
Plus there are still two from last week suggested by Brian that are still up for grabs:
[SR-906](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-906): Allow XCTestCase.continueAfterFailure to be set
[SR-875](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-875): Make swift-corelibs-xctest Functional tests regex matching more like FileCheck

[Last issue](/issue-13/) we started listing starter tasks for beginners, but more advanced tasks could be listed here, too. There were no submissions this week, so please help share the news! ðŸ˜„ If there is a task that you would like to submit, open [an issue]({{ site.links.issue }}) or [pull request]({{ site.links.pull }}) &mdash; or tweet [to me](https://twitter.com/jesse_squires) or [@swiftlybrief]({{ site.links.twitter }}).
