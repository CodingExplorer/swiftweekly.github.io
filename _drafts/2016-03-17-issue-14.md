Welcome to issue #14 of the weekly brief! Just like [Dave Verwer](https://iosdevweekly.com/issues/241#start), I've been anticipating the final release of Xcode 7.3 &mdash; as well as iOS 9.3, OS X 10.11.4, and watchOS 2.2. Xcode 7.3 will include the final version of Swift 2.2. Perhaps the core team will "[loop us in](http://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/10/apple-invites-march-21-event/)" next Monday. ðŸ˜‰
